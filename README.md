Hand-Written Digit Recognition Using GoLearn
--------------------------------------------

This is a simple example of how to do basic digit recognition using [GoLearn](https://github.com/sjwhitworth/golearn).
Using traing data from the popular MNIST database of hand-written digits, the code creates and trains a simple linear
SVC, which can acheive an accuracy of about 86% on a test data set (data not previously seen by the classifier).
I expect that more advanced classifiers can probably get better results, but this one runs fast and serves as
a great demo.
